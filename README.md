## Q&A and Discussions

We will be using Blackboard for email, questions, and class discussions. Rather than emailing questions, I highly encourage you to post your questions on Blackboard.

## Course Description

The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to and hands on experience with all phases of the data science process using real data and modern tools. Topics that will be covered include data formats, loading, cleaning, data storage in relational & non-relational stores and data visualization.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, students will be able to:

*	Understand conceptually the basics of machine learning like hypothesis space, probability, classifier, dimensionality reduction, cross validation etc.
*	Be introduced to basic unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering
* Learn a few key supervised learning techniques. Examples include decision trees, linear and logistic regression, Bayesian classifiers, Support Vector Machines
* Apply the learned techniques to some analytics problem through a project.

## Course Format and Assignments

Students will complete assigned homework assignments, readings, projects. This course incorporates a variety of hands-on labs and practical exercises to engage students and prepare them for challenges they may encounter in a workplace.

The final project will provide students opportunity to showcase what they have learned in a format similar to what they will encounter in a professional work setting.

## Grading Criteria

Students are expected to participate in class discussions. Student participation is encouraged & expected; watching recorded lectures outside of class does not count towards attendance!

Homework assignment will be mostly due Sunday. For homework due dates please check the - Weekly schedule below.

## Course Policies

## Assignments

UMBC provides a range of writing assistance, which can be found in the following:

- The Writing Center: http://lrc.umbc.edu/tutor/writing-center/

- Research Guides & Tutorials: http://lib.guides.umbc.edu/tutorial

Failure to follow guidelines for each assignment, including the required format, style, length, and submission may result in at least one-letter-grade reduction on the assignment depending on the type or number of transgressions.

## Late Assignments

### NO late/incomplete assignments will be accepted! Emergency situations will be handled on a case by case basis with appropriate justification and/or documentation.

Incomplete grades are granted only for extenuating circumstances and your request is made before the last - Week of class.

## Academic Integrity

If published work produced by someone else is used, cite the contribution in your assignment submission. If a website is referenced, specify the full URL of the source. If your own work from a previous or concurrent course is used, specify that in the assignment submission.  Uncited references for software code and essays is plagiarism. 

Discussion of assignments with other students is not allowed until all work associated with that assignment has been graded. __Submit your own independent work.__ __Sharing of work is not acceptable.__ Explaining your approach to other students must wait until everyone has a grade for their assignment.
If plagiarism is an issue, the instructor of the course can select from a range of penalty responses. Examples include a written warning (registered with UMBC’s administrators), assigning a zero for the submitted work, decreasing the course score by less than a letter grade, decreasing the course grade by 1 or more letter grades, or assigning an F for the course grade.

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an active participant in UMBC’s scholarly community in which everyone’s academic work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty.  Cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and helping other to commit these acts are all forms of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong.  Academic misconduct could result in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to failure, suspension or dismissal.  

Refer to the UMBC policy on Academic Integrity: http://catalog.umbc.edu/content.php?catoid=17&navoid=879#academic-integrity.
Student Academic Misconduct in the Grad School is handled by the Associate Dean of the Grad School. The first step is for the instructor to consult with the AD. If the instructor and AD determine that a less serious infraction has occurred, then the AD provides written authority to the instructor to resolve the matter. The instructor then notifies the students in writing, and the students must be allowed the opportunity to provide an explanation. The student has the right to appeal the decision directly to the AD, and the student must be informed of this right. If an appeal is requested, then the AD will convene a Grievance Committee under the policy established by University of Maryland Graduate School, Baltimore (UMGSB).
Incidents are tracked by UMBC. Repeated infractions incur more severe penalties. 



## Student Disability Services (SDS)
UMBC is committed to eliminating discriminatory obstacles that may disadvantage students based on disability. Services for students with disabilities are provided for all students qualified under the Americans with Disabilities Act is the UMBC department designated to coordinate reasonable accommodations that would allow students to have equal access and inclusion in all courses, programs, and activities of the University.
If you have a documented disability and need to request academic accommodations, please register with the Office of Student Disability Services as soon as possible. To begin the registration process please visit the SDS website and review the registration information, including disability documentation guidelines and how to submit the SDS registration form online using the confidential data management software called Accommodate https://sds.umbc.edu/accommodations/registering-with-sds/. 
Once accommodations have been approved, you and your instructors will be notified via an emailed accommodation letter from the SDS office.  Both the SDS office and Shady Grove's Center for Academic Successwill work with you to ensure you receive the approved accommodations. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Office of Student Disability Services via disAbility@umbc.edu or phone at 410-455-2459. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and begin once SDS sends an approved accommodation letter.
For more information on the services CAS provides, please contact Mary Gallagher or visit https://shadygrove.umd.edu/student-services/center-for-academic-success.
